Hey there! We want to implement a reservation button. At the moment, it brings up a modal, but the modal doesn't do anything. What we need to do is call the following n8n webhook endpoint. This webhook expects a name, the party size, and the date and time as a date time field.

You should not call this directive from the front end. This webhook might have authentication on it, so we need to securely call this from the back end. I suggest creating an API in Next.js or a server action or a route handler.
